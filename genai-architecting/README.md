## Functional Requirements

The company wants to use an economical paid hosted solution rather than owning their own infrastructure. This will enable them to easily scale as needed based on usage demand, and also adopt new solutions that may require quickly evolving hardware.

## Assumptions

We assume an economical hosted solution will provide sufficient capabilities for the desired applications.

## Data Strategy

Only if further testing indicates it is required, we will incorporate RAG using either a paid or in-house built dataset.

## Considerations

We are considering using either Google Gemini 2.0 Flash or Google Gemini 2.0 Pro.  The use of Gemini will enable us to focus on our core business rather than maintaining additional infrastructure, while easily adopting newer models over time.
